== Description ==

Web2Lead enables SugarCRM lead record generation from a Wordpress-based website. This free version contains a basic contact form and creates a SugarCRM lead record assigned to a specified user.

This plugin was developed on Worpress v3.2.1, SugarCRM CE v6.2.4 and PHP v5.3.8. 
PHP 5.2.6 or later is required due to the internal PHP SOAP libraries used.

== Installation ==

Installation is simple - just go to Plugins > Add New. Then upload the zip file. Wordpress takes care of the rest.
